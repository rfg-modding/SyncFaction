# RSL

https://rsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html

The [Visual Studio 2019 x86 Redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads/) is required for RSL. You might need to fully restart your PC for the install to properly complete.

probably shouldn't even use it with the steam or discord overlays even if it appears to work.

Here's the script that lets you "control" the flyer. Still need to find the script that teleports you into the drivers seat. Originally included a mod that put the flyer in the safehouse spawn too, but that isn't strictly needed.

pretty sure it was just the safehouse vehicle spawn mod slightly modified

Lift objects with the power of your mind! Throw EDF vehicles off cliffs, or through buildings. Use debris and other heavy objects as weapons.

Download and unzip this mod. Copy it's folder into your ï»¿"RSL/Scripts" folder, so you now have a folder "RSL/Scripts/Telekinesis" containing a single file, main.lua.
Start the game as usual with the RSL enabled. The script will automatically load itself when you load a save game. If your RSL version is out of date a message will pop up when you load a save.
If you ever want the mod to not load on startup, just rename or delete it's main.lua file.

Controls
t - Toggle telekinesis on the object you're pointing at. The object being controlled will have a orange glow around it. Note that some objects can't be moved by telekinesis at the moment.
q/e - Increase/decrease telekinesis strength by 10. Hold ctrl while pressing q or e to change strength by 100 instead.
f - Throw the object you're currently lifting in the direction you're aiming
Ctrl + mouse wheel scroll  - Change the distance that the object you're lifting is from you. Scroll down to bring it closer, scroll up to move it further away.
