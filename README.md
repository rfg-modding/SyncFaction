## Project goals

* Decent **multiplayer** experience: 1-click update to latest game version and jump into action!
* **ModManager** replacement for **singleplayer** with less bugs and online package management
* Less headaches for users: autoupdates, mod discovery, no manual file management, simplified troubleshooting
* Aid for mod development: documentation, support for multiple kinds of mods. From simple file replacement to resource editing with user inputs

## Installation

Download [latest release](https://github.com/rfg-modding/SyncFaction/releases) and place .exe in game folder. That's it!

> You will need at least **20GiB** (TODO measure with terraform rebuild) of free storage space
