Ideas, notes about features, testing, release process, etc

## Release

* remove hack for old update IDs (rfgcommunityupdate)
* see if logs look nice without dev mode and with it
* test on both steam and gog versions
* test with terraform rebuild
* simulate terraform rebuild and RSL uploaded to FF
* rename/move/create FF categories
* document modinfo.xml
* document mod structure and all the magic
* make examples
  * to avoid clutter, instruct users to place modinfo.xml and all relative stuff into a subfolder
* testing
  * loose vpp files
  * new vpps
  * modinfo in subdir
  * combinations of stuff
  * hash file
  * test if preserve whitespace works for files like anim_files.xtbl - they should not be formatted/minimized

* port/network checker?
  * inspect how game uses network for client and host modes
