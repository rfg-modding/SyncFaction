# Modding/Intro

Welcome to documentation for modders! These pages will guide you through mod development and distribution process. However, i won't describe in detail how game works, how resources are structured etc. There is [FactionFiles Wiki](https://www.redfactionwiki.com/wiki/RF:G_Editing_Main_Page) entry for that.

## TODO

* overview of concepts
* mod structure
* key features: file replacements, loose archives, modinfo.xml
